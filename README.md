# mic18-Hardware-Video-Decompressor
This project implements a hardware video decompressor for the mic18 standard from McMaster University's 3DQ5 course. Originally designed for image decompression on Altera FPGAs, it's been extended to process video streams as sequential mic18 compressed frames. The system has been reimplemented for Xilinx FPGA platforms.
